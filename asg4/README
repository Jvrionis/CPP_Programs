This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Maximillian Brain (mbrain@ucsc.edu)
Partner: James Vrionis (jvrionis@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone.  Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner.  The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Maximillian Brain spent       4 hours working alone
James Vrionis spent           2 hours working alone
We spent                      30 hours together
Maximillian Brain spent       15 hours driving
James Vrionis spent           15 hours driving
